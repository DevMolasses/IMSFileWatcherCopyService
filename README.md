# IMS File Watcher Copy Service
An Integrated Monitoring System (IMS) is a remote monitoring device used to collect data from machinery. Normally, an IMS in installed on remote and/or mobile machinery. However, one IMS has been installed locally in a test booth and connected to the LAN.

This Windows service is designed to monitor the data files that are created on the IMS and copy them to a network server for archival purposes as the files are created.

#Project Highlight
I am particularly proud of how the seperation of concerns worked out in this project. Up to this point, I struggled with the ideas of seperating methods into different classes, but I used this project as my opportunity to work to really seperate my program into appropriate classes.

Also, this was my first Windows Service application which was a unique challenge on its own.
